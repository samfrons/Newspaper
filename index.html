"National Weather Service is tracking a tropical storm about seventy-five miles west of us." Hammond sighs and looks over Arnold's shoulder. "Why didn't I build in Orlando?" "I'll keep an eye on it.

A whole herd of dinosaurs crosses the plain, maybe a hundred that we see in a quick glance alone. "Ellie, they're absolutely - - they're moving in herds. They do move in herds!" "We were right!" "How did you do it?! How did you do this?!"
